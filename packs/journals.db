{"_id":"9MiuSxnNg0W6bT27","name":"5. Day Five - Lighting it Up","content":"<h2>Introduction</h2>\n<p>Sometimes running scared all the time isn’t the answer. Kalisz was a disaster, sure. But we were there to do a job. The Soviets had hit us hard with mechanized infantry, tanks, BMPs, you name it. They moved so fast we didn’t even see them coming. When we figured out how they did it and had a chance to deliver our own thank you note, well, the chance was too good to miss…</p>\n<h2>Overview</h2>\n<p>After the last few days of hiding and watching enemy units mop up the surrounding countryside, you do a double take with what you’re seeing today. Down there, on a deserted stretch of road is a tanker. A complete tractor-trailer tanker. And it’s on its own. Just a couple of crew who have had the bad luck of breaking down with no-one else around. It seems too good to be true but after waiting to see if anyone else was around and scouting around it seems fate has handed you an opportunity too good to miss.</p>\n<h2>The Situation</h2>\n<p>Lighting It Up is set soon after the PCs make good their escape from Kalisz as they travel through Poland. It is intended to act as an encounter where PCs can plan their attack carefully for maximum effect. It can also set the scene for a series of encounters that trace the PCs doing what they can to counter the Soviet success on the battlefield.</p>\n<p>The plot revolves around the discovery that a large part of the success of the Soviets’ advance was because of their access to gasoline. This increased the speed and range of their mechanized forces and contributed to their ability to quickly surround centers of NATO resistance.</p>\n<p>To support the expected counter-offensive against the III US Corps, the 3rd Guards Shock Army HQ in Warsaw stockpiled gasoline for many weeks leading up to the disastrous Operation Reset offensive. Following behind the spear of the 35th Guards Air Assault Brigade were companies of logistics support bringing in supplies via tankers. Hastily constructed temporary compounds housing the tankers were set up behind friendly lines to shorten the supply lines. With all available fighting units committed to the offensive, the logistics transport companies had to see to their own defense. Deemed a necessity at the time, this decision nonetheless creates an opportunity for retreating NATO units brave enough to create serious problems for the Soviet resupply.</p>\n<p>The PCs come across one of these compounds, and with careful planning will potentially be able to destroy a significant portion of the Soviet fuel. They discover its location via sloppy security on the part of one of the tanker crews who the PCs catch unawares during an unfortunate breakdown. </p>\n<h2>Location Summary</h2>\n<p>The first part of this encounter is with the stricken tanker and its hapless crew. The PCs will be rightly cautious of the situation and should check to ensure the tanker is on its own. A gentle reminder that they sure could use the fuel, especially if you’ve contrived to have them running low on supplies ahead of this encounter, may help nudge them into action. Assuming they hit the tanker they discover orders and a map locating their nearby compound. They also discover that it’s not alcohol they’re hauling. It’s gasoline.</p>\n<p>The compound is the second location. It can be safely reconnoitered from the nearby forest, although the approach to it is obviously guarded. If the PCs settle in to observe for some time, they will quickly ascertain that the defending force is clearly not a combat unit, and may be vulnerable to a covert operation to destroy the fuel supplies.</p>\n<p>Getting into the compound and to the tankers will be the toughest part of the mission, but once inside, the security is relatively lax. There are several options they could consider:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Create a distraction nearby to draw attention away from their ingress.</li>\n<li>Hijack a Soviet vehicle and bluff their way in.</li>\n<li>Attempt a frontal assault, perhaps with other scattered NATO groups and/or locals that they recruit.</li>\n<li>Hit the tankers from range (with an RPG or mortar for example) and hope that the fires spread.</li>\n<li>Break in under the cover of darkness.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Countdown</h2>\n<p>This opportunity won’t last forever. After the assault on Kalisz/Arboga, the Soviets need a few days to regroup and resupply. Exactly how long is up to you. Over that time, the following events occur:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Units make contact with the compound via radio and request resupply with increasing frequency.</li>\n<li>Tankers begin to leave, at first in ones and twos, then in convoys of up to five, quickly emptying the compound of its 14 truck and trailer units.</li>\n<li>After a few of days of heightened activity, the compound is empty of its tankers and the remaining soldiers pack down the perimeter and prepare to move out in their (gasoline-filled) @Compendium[t2k4e-coreset.core-set-actors.RtAIApvIGOdPesR5]{ZIL-131}s and accompanying @Compendium[t2k4e-coreset.core-set-actors.p77CPoj5eZdP7qKy]{UAZ-469B}. </li>\n</ul>\n<h2>Locations</h2>\n<h3>The Stricken Tanker</h3>\n<p>The first location is the lone tanker the PCs come across that starts this encounter. If that goes well the PCs will discover two things:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The tanker is carrying gasoline.</li>\n<li>Orders and a map that locates the compound from which it has come and which indicates the size of the resupply unit.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Use any battle map you like for this location. For the crew, use Soviet Soldier, Referee’s Manual, page 37. For the tankers, both this one and the others, use Heavy Truck for the tractor unit (Player’s Manual, page 116). For the trailer unit, assume it has armor 2 on all sides.</p>\n<p> </p>","folder":null,"sort":0,"permission":{"default":0,"xrutfo08ZKgCmTKc":3},"flags":{"scene-packer":{"sourceId":"JournalEntry.9MiuSxnNg0W6bT27","hash":"f936b280eeed506a7d5499ca81170deb6f475d44"},"cf":{"id":"temp_dc6mwpxz927","path":"Escape from Kalisz#/CF_SEP/5.

Most of us didn’t even last that long. We never saw the enemy coming. When the Division HQ started shouting over the radio, it was already too late. The tanks of the Soviet 6th Guards Motor Rifle Brigade hit them hard at dawn, five klicks north of Kalisz.</p>\n<p>The proud US 5th Mechanized Infantry Division - now just a band of scattered stragglers, spread out all over hell. Running for our lives. Dying in the Polish dirt, which had been cratered and irradiated by tactical nukes from both sides.</p>\n<p>Not that we were a particularly grand bunch when this operation started. A ragtag gang of jolly green giants, walking the Earth with guns. Soldiers. Not just Americans - in our ranks we had Poles, Czechs, Germans, you name it. Even civilians. Hell, by the end we’d take in anyone who had a gun and knew which way to point it.</p>\n<p>The command and supply chains broke down back in ‘98, when the US and Soviet naval forces obliterated each other on the high seas of the North Atlantic and the air resupply collapsed. After that, our forces over here in Europe were stranded. Living off the land. Falling apart.</p>\n<p>When we first heard about Operation Reset, we couldn’t believe it. The first major offensive by NATO forces in Europe in over a year. The order was to link up with other US forces under III Corps and push our way to Warsaw, or what’s left of it. We weren’t told why. Some said it was the last hurrah, a final try to save the world as we knew it. We didn’t care. We just knew it was a Hail Mary, a desperate gamble in the most desperate of times. And maybe, just maybe, a chance to find a ride home.</p>\n<p>It was no surprise that it went to hell. Most things have in the last few years.</p>\n<p>Some say it didn’t have to be this way. Some say history could have taken a different turn. If the Soviet Union had collapsed back in ‘91 when it was on the ropes. If the Gang of Eight coup against Gorbachev had failed, the world would have looked very different today. Some say. I think it’s bullshit. This storm was always coming, sooner or later.</p>\n<p>It doesn’t matter anymore, anyway. Now, all that matters is to survive each day.</p>\n<p>It’s all up to us now. Our squad. Jonesy.
